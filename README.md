## Nand2Tetris
Nand2Tetris is a project-based course that teaches you how to build a modern computer system from the ground up. Starting with just the basic logic gates, you'll gradually construct more complex components like adders, registers, and even a CPU that can run simple programs.

In this Project We implemented all structures in C#
